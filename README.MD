In some cases is a compact plain extract of main knowledge, in others, it is a composition from different sources, all accompanied by live examples, comments, and whole apps code. Initially, contents were copied in 2018-2019, with further updates based on upgrade guides, change logs, etc. In some cases, there are no direct links to sources, as the book initially was not planned to be released.
