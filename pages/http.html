<h3 id="rm">Request Methods</h3>

  <h4>GET - request data from a specified resource</h4>
  query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL : /test/demo_form.php?name1=value1&name2=value2

  <ul>
    <li>can be cached</li>
    <li>remain in the browser history</li>
    <li>can be bookmarked</li>
    <li>should never be used when dealing with sensitive data</li>
    <li>have length restrictions</li>
    <li>only used to request data (not modify)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>POST - send data to a server to create/update a resource</h4>
  data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request

  <pre><code class="python">
  POST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1
  Host: w3schools.com
  name1=value1&amp;name2=value2
  </code></pre>

  <ul>
    <li>POST requests are never cached</li>
    <li>POST requests do not remain in the browser history</li>
    <li>POST requests cannot be bookmarked</li>
    <li>POST requests have no restrictions on data length</li>
  </ul>

  <br/>
  <h4>PUT - send data to a server to create/update a resource</h4>
  difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times

  <h4>DELETE - deletes the specified resource</h4>

  <h4>OPTIONS - describes the communication options for the target resource</h4>

  <h4>GET vs. POST</h4>
