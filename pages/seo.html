<h1>SEO</h1>

<h2 id="checklist">SEO Checklist</h2>

  <h3>1. Page content and images</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The content of each page has been checked to ensure that there are no spelling / grammar errors</li>
    <li>The content of each page is simple to understand for the target audience</li>
    <li>The content of each page is relevant, engaging and fresh</li>
    <li>Each page uses adequate relevant images</li>
    <li>Each image has been legally purchased / licensed or
      created in-house</li>
    <li>The text is split into columns or grids to make it
      easy for readers</li>
    <li>None of the text blocks are greater than 60% of the width of a page</li>
    <li>The header contains: company name, logo, social media
      profile links, navigation menu, email address</li>
    <li>The content of each page is in inverted pyramid format
      with most important content on top and least important at the bottom</li>
    <li>All sentences are adequately short and the words used
      are simple to understand</li>
    <li>All paragraphs are adequately short</li>
    <li>Content focuses on the benefits to the users instead
      of the features</li>
    <li>Create a useful, information-rich site,
      and write pages that clearly and accurately describe your content</li>
    <li>Dont embed important text inside
      images</li>
    <li>Give your images detailed, informative
      filenames e.g. my-new-black-kitten.jpg instead of IMG00023.JPG</li>
    <li>Create great alt text e.g. &lt;img
        src="puppy.jpg" alt="Dalmatian puppy playing fetch"&gt;</li>
    <li>Place images near the relevant text</li>
    <li>Good-quality photos appeal to users more
      than blurry, unclear images</li>
    <li>Specify a width and height for all
      images</li>
    <li>Think about the words users would type
      to find your pages, and make sure that your site actually includes those words within it</li>
    <li>Try to use text instead of images to
      display important names, content, or links</li>
    <li>The Google crawler doesnt recognize
      text contained in images. If you must use images for textual content, consider using the ALT attribute to include a
      few words of descriptive text</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2. Duplicate content</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Duplicate content does not exist on different
      sub-domains</li>
    <li>Duplicate content does not exist on different domains
      owned by the same organization</li>
    <li>Duplicate content does not exist on the "secure"
      version of the site</li>
    <li>Duplicate content does not exist on printer friendly
      version of the site?</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>3. Quality guidelines</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Make pages primarily for users, not for
      search engines</li>
    <li>Dont deceive your users</li>
    <li>Avoid tricks intended to improve search
      engine rankings. A good rule of thumb is whether youd feel comfortable explaining what youve done to a website
      that competes with you, or to a Google employee. Another useful test is to ask, "Does this help my users? Would I
      do this if search engines didnt exist?"</li>
    <li>Think about what makes your website
      unique, valuable, or engaging</li>
    <li>Make your website stand out from others
      in your field</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>4. Page Design</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Each page has sufficient white space so that the page
      does not appear cluttered</li>
    <li>Each page is designed to maximize user attention</li>

    <li>Where relevant, bulleted / numbered lists are used to
      make the content easy to read</li>
    <li>There is a clear distinction between the header,
      content and footer sections on each page</li>
    <li>The color scheme of all pages is consistent</li>

      devices</li>

    <li>Make a site with a clear hierarchy and
      text links</li>
    <li>Offer a sitemap to your users with links

  <h3>10. Technical Guidelines</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Content shows properly even if the JavaScript, cookies, and CSS are turned off</li>
    <li>Navigation links work even if the JavaScript, cookies, and CSS are turned off</li>
    <li>Analytics tracking code is on every page</li>
    <li>To help Google fully understand your
      sites contents, allow all of your sites assets, such as CSS and JavaScript files, to be crawled</li>
    <li>Allow search bots to crawl your sites
      without session IDs or arguments that track their path through the site</li>
    <li>Make sure your web server supports the
      If-Modified-Since HTTP header</li>
    <li>Make use of the robots.txt file on your
      web server. This file tells crawlers which directories can or cannot be crawled. Make sure its current for your
      site so that you dont accidentally block the Googlebot crawler</li>
    <li>Use robots.txt to prevent crawling of
      search results pages or other auto-generated pages that dont add much value for users coming from search engines</li>
    <li>Test your site to make sure that it
      appears correctly in different browsers</li>
    <li>Monitor your sites performance and
      optimize load times</li>
    <li>Google strongly recommends that all
      webmasters regularly monitor site performance</li>
    <li>Check for broken links and incorrect
      HTML</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>11. URLs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No URL should contain excessive parameters or session IDs</li>
    <li>All URLs exposed to search engines should be static</li>
    <li>If you decide to use dynamic pages (i.e., the URL contains a "?" character), be aware that not every search engine spider crawls dynamic pages as well as static pages. It helps to keep the parameters short and the number of the few</li>
  </ul>
